INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design! Power estimation will be inaccurate until this is corrected.
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate
