# Cern General Cores has Many different licenses
# https://www.ohwr.org/projects/general-cores
# So for SiriusHDL we only want files that are Apache or Solderpad 2.x licensed
# get_general_cores.sh can retreive the  latest files from General Cores that we use
# the resulting files are checked into SiriusHDL directly.
