*******
Purpose
*******
.. _wb_purpose:

This FFT was originally sourced from ASTRON via OpenCores. It performs an N-Point Wideband FFT on data that is partly applied in serial and partly applied in
parallel. This FFT specifically suits applications where the sample clock is higher than the DSP processing clock. For each output stream a subband statistic
unit is included which can be read via the memory mapped interface.

This unit connects an incoming array of streaming interfaces to the wideband fft. The output of the wideband fft is 
connected to a set of subband statistics units. The statistics can be read via the memory mapped interface (TODO). 
A control unit takes care of the correct composition of the output streams(sop,eop,sync,bsn,err). These signals are 
optional and can be removed to only use the sync signal.

This unit only handles one sync at a time. Therefore the sync interval should be larger than the total
pipeline stages of the wideband FFT.

***************
Module Overview
***************
.. _wb_module:

An overview of the fft_wide unit is shown in Figure 1. The fft_wide unit calculates a N-point FFT and has P
number of input streams. Data of each input is offered to a M-point pipelined FFT, where M=N/P. The output
of all pipelined FFTs is then connected to a P-point parallel FFT that performs the final stage of the wideband
FFT. Each output of the parallel FFT is connected to a subband statistics unit that calculates the power in
each subband. The MM interface is used to read out the subband statistics.
The rTwoSDF pipelined FFT (see :ref:`r2sdf_fft`) design is used as building block for the development of the wideband extension.

=============
Clock Domains
=============
There are two clock domains used in the fft_wide unit: the mm_clk and the dp_clk domain. Figure 2 shows
an overview of the clock domains in the fft_wide unit. The only unit that is connected to both clock domains is
the memory of the subband statistics module. This memory is a dual ported ram that holds the results of the
subband statistics. Table 1 lists both clocks and their characteristics.

| DP_CLK | 200 MHz        | Clock for datapath     |

+----------------+-----------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

-----------
Complex FFT
-----------
For complex input use_separate = false.
When use_reorder=true then the output bins of the FFT are re-ordered to 
undo the bit-reversed (or bit-flipped) default radix 2 FFT output order.
The fft_r2_wide then outputs first 0 Hz and the positive frequencies
and then the negative frequencies. The use_reorder is performed at both
the pipelined stage and the parallel stage.

When use_fft_shift=true then the fft_r2_wide then outputs the frequency
bins in incrementing order, so first the negative frequencies, then 0 Hz
and then the positive frequencies.
When use_fft_shift = true then also use_reorder must be true.

--------------
Two Real FFT's
--------------
When use_separate=true then the fft_r2_wide can be used to process two
real streams. The first real stream (A) presented on the real input, the
second real stream (B) presented on the imaginary input. The separation
unit outputs the spectrum of A and B in an alternating way.
When use_separate = true then also use_reorder must be true.
When use_separate = true then the use_fft_shift must be false, because
fft_shift() only applies to spectra for complex input.

-------
Remarks
-------
This FFT supports a wb_factor = 1 (= only a fft_r2_pipe
instance) or wb_factor = g_fft.nof_points (= only a fft_r2_par instance).
Care must be taken to properly account for guard_w and out_gain_w,
therefore it is best to simply use a structural approach that generates
seperate instances for each case:

* wb_factor = 1                                  --> pipelined FFT
* wb_factor > 1 AND wb_factor < g_fft.nof_points --> wideband FFT
* wb_factor = g_fft.nof_points                   --> parallel FFT

This FFT uses the use_reorder in the pipeline FFT, in the parallel
FFT and also has reorder memory in the fft_sepa_wide instance. The reorder
memories in the FFTs can maybe be saved by using only the reorder memory
in the fft_sepa_wide instance. This would require changing the indexing in
fft_sepa_wide instance (TODO).

The reorder memory in the pipeline FFT, parallel FFT and in the
fft_sepa_wide could make reuse of a reorder component from the reorder
library instead of using a dedicated local solution (TODO).

*******************
Module Architecture
*******************
.. _wb_arch:

Several subdesigns were defined in order to create the eventual wideband decimation in frequency (DIF) FFT. These sub-designs are:

- Complex Pipelined FFT for two real inputs (fft_r2_pipe).
- Complex Parallel FFT for two real inputs (fft_r2_par).
- Complex Wideband FFT for two real inputs (fft_r2_wide).

===========
fft_r2_pipe
===========
The architecture for a pipelined FFT is based on design units from the rTwoSDF_lib and is basically the same as the rTwoSDF unit. The difference with respect to the rTwoSDF unit is that
the fft_r2_pipe unit must be capable of processing two real inputs as well. Therefore the archtectural block diagram is extended with an optional separate function. Figure 4 gives an
archtectural overview of the design.

.. image:: ./_images/fft_r2_pipe.png
  :scale: 75 %
  :alt: Simulink wideband FFT in base configuration. 

==========
fft_r2_par
==========

In the case of a parallel FFT, all time domain samples for a slice come in parallel and therefore all multiplications and additions have to be performed in parallel as well. The architecture
for a parallel for a parallel FFT is shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5, the number of points is set to 16. Each square represents an optimised complex butterfly. The numbers in the butterfly
refer to the exponent k in :math:`W_N^k` (the twiddle factors). The parallel FFT is also capable of reordering the output data and processing two real inputs. Therefore a parallel reorder
and parallel separate function are defined as well.

.. image:: ./_images/fft_r2_par.png
  :scale: 75 %
  :alt: Simulink wideband FFT in base configuration. 


===========
fft_r2_wide
===========
The wideband variant of the FFT is partly pipelined and partly composed in parallel. The amount of parallelization is specified by P (wideband factor). The architecture is shown in Figure
6. The reorder functionality is inherited from both the fft_r2_par and fft_r2_pipe units, but for the separation functionality a dedicated wideband variant must be designed.

============
Quantisation
============
.. _wb_quant:

Requantisation is required for every butterfly in the FFT. With the FFT being a DIF FFT, the butterfly operation is shown in Figure 7 and it's algorithmic operation is detailed below:

.. math:: 
   x' = x + y

.. math:: 
   y' = W_N^k \times (x - y)

.. image:: ./_images/dif_butterfly.png
  :scale: 68 %
  :alt: Simulink wideband FFT in base configuration. 

Each butterfly performs an addition and multiplication. For fixed point number systems of values in the range :math:`(0.5, -0.5]` we get MSB growth from additions and LSB growth from
multiplications. The LSB growth from multiplication may be sliced away (which introduces minor effects due to the rounding scheme). This wideband FFT offers the option to truncate 
or round away from zero (TODO: introduce even rounding).
MSB growth from addition will cause overflow that may be handled in two ways: SATURATE the value or WRAP it. Wrapping will use no logic while saturation will require logic to prevent
natural wrapping. Ideally however, the effect of overflow in the FFT is irreversible and as such should be prevented. This is done by scaling the data by 2 before entry into each stage,
and by extension each butterfly operating in parallel for that stage. Fine-control over which stages the FFT should apply a shift for is possible by populating the shiftregister port.
Should overflow occur in any of the butterflies in the FFT, the overflow register will populate that bit-index with a '1'. Figure 8 shows the location of the overflow reporting and shift
within the butterfly.

The shift operation acts on value :math:`A` as:

.. math::
   A' = round(A >> 1, "Rounding behaviour")

where :math:`round()` is a function that rounds the value :math:`A` according to the "Rounding behaviour" specified see :ref:`_wb_fft_params`.

Overflow is detected in a stage by inspecting the sign of the input to the adder and sign of the output. This check differs depending on whether a subtraction or addition is being performed.
The following VHDL snippets make this check (TODO):
