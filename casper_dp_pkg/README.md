## About this core

This is a collection of commonly used base functions, used in all of ASTRONs
cores that have a DP (based on Avalon) streaming interface.

These source files can work in any environment, however it is recommended to
use the RadioHDL tool to easily generate project files for e.g. Modelsim,
Quartus and Vivado (see 'About hdllib.cfg and the RadioHDL tool').

## Test bench(es)
This core does not contain a test bench. Note that tb_dp_pkg.vhd does have a
'tb' prefix but is a package file containing useful simulation functions.

## Dependencies
This core has the following dependencies:

common_pkg

## Source files
The source files are listed hdllib.cfg.

## More information about this core
Each source file comes with a header containing more information.

## About hdllib.cfg and the RadioHDL tool
The hdllib.cfg file is included in all ASTRONs cores and is a config file that
is detected by the RadioHDL development tool (also on OpenCores). 

The source files are in order of dependency. However, some or all files could 
also be standalone.

The section 'test_bench_files' can list test benches, but also simulation-only
source files that are not test benches.
